I want to add RAG chatbot feature that can let the RAG chatbot to answer questions based on internal file contents.
the RAG chatbot should not intergrate into the main chatbot interface.
the RAG chatbot should have its own interface that can be accessed by the main chatbot interface through the setting button on the main chatbot interface.
the RAG chatbot can only be used when the user login to the main chatbot interface and the user should select the RAG chatbot interface from the setting button on the main chatbot interface.

the RAG chatbot should be able to answer questions based on the file contents.

 the file contents are stored in the /filesource folder.
 the file contents are:
 - /filesource/1.txt
 - /filesource/2.txt
 - /filesource/3.txt    

 the RAG chatbot function should use the langchain library. 
 the vector store should use the chroma library.
 the embedding model can use the openai library or other embedding model.
