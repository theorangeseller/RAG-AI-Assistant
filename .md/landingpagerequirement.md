I want to make a AI chatbot web interface that can do things as below

#functionality  
1. User can login with Google account and Microsoft account
2. The login authentication should support OAuth 2.0, JWT, and Email/Password, and after login, the user should be redirected to the chat page with user's name and profile picture.
3. If the user is not logged in, the user should be just redirected to the chat page with a login button, but the chat history will not be saved.
4. User can chat with the bot
5. User can view the chat history if the user is logged in
6. User can delete the chat history if the user is logged in
7. User can ask the chatbot to do things like search the web, search the files, search the knowledge base, and the chatbot should be able to handle the conversation and the context.
