I want to make my chatbot web application can be authenticate through Microsoft account or sign in with username and password.
the username and password information should be store in supabase database. when I click the sigin button in the chatbot page, it will redirect to the sigin page with have all the authenticate options.
I want to use supabase to store the username and password information.
I don't want supabase to handle Microsoft sigin flow, only username and passwrod sigin. 
I want my application to handle Microsoft sigin flow reference Microsoft authentication development documentation.
I need to install a library for handling OAuth for Microsoft sigin. For example, I want to use msal (Microsoft Authentication Library) in my application.
I want my sigin page modern,clean and beautiful.
